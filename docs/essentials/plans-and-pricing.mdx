## Understanding Your Resources

### Agents
Intelligent AI agents that connect to your data and systems to deliver consistent, validated results. Each agent includes built-in features like output schema validation, auto-improving prompts, smart context management, and custom business logic.

### Compute Credits
One compute credit represents the computational resources needed to power your agents' processing, API calls, validation loops, and decision-making. Our efficient resource allocation means you only pay for actual agent activity and other compute time such as MCP Server requests and other flow function processing, not idle time.

### Storage
Unified storage for all your agent data including conversation history, memory, workflow outputs, document processing, and system logs. This integrated approach eliminates the need to manage separate storage services.

### Edge Locations
Deploy your agents closer to your users and data sources for optimal performance. Multiple edge locations provide redundancy and reduce latency for global operations.

## How We're Different from Other Platforms

### vs. Simple Automation Tools (Zapier, Microsoft Power Automate)
**Their Limitation**: Rigid automation that breaks on exceptions
**Microstrate Advantage**: Intelligent agents that adapt, learn, and handle edge cases automatically

### vs. Developer Frameworks (LangChain, Custom Development)
**Their Challenge**: Building agent infrastructure from scratch takes months
**Microstrate Advantage**: Production-grade multi-agent orchestration with advanced features built-in

### vs. Basic AI Platforms
**Their Problem**: Generic AI without business context
**Microstrate Advantage**: Business-aware agents using your proprietary data with validation

### vs. Closed Ecosystems
**Their Issue**: Vendor lock-in with limited portability
**Microstrate Advantage**: Open standards (MCP, OpenAPI) with portable, future-proof solutions

## Common Questions

### How do agents consume compute credits?
Agents use compute credits for processing conversations, executing business logic, making API calls, running validation loops, and performing schema corrections. Our efficient architecture means you only pay for active agent work, not idle time.

### What happens if I exceed my plan limits?
If you are on the free plan, you will need to upgrade to a paid plan to increase your limits. If you are on a paid plan, to ensure predictable billing, as you approach your account limits, you will be notified and asked to upgrade to a more suitable plan before your plan limits are exceeded.

### Can I change between annual and monthly billing?
Yes, you can switch between monthly and annual billing at any time. When upgrading to annual, you'll receive the 20% discount immediately. When switching from annual to monthly, the change takes effect at your next billing cycle.

### Can I change plans anytime?
Yes, you can upgrade immediately for instant access to new capabilities. Downgrades take effect at your next billing cycle, and we'll ensure a smooth transition.

### Do you offer custom enterprise solutions?
Absolutely. Our Enterprise plan includes white-label options, on-premise deployment, custom SLAs, and strategic consulting to meet your specific transformation needs.

### How quickly can I get started?
You can create your first intelligent agent in minutes. Our Free plan requires no credit card, and our visual flow builder makes complex agent creation accessible to both technical and business users.
