- Pro Monthly: $19/user × 10 users = $190/month × 12 = $2,280/year

- **Save $480/year (20%)**

## Understanding Your Bill

### Billing Cycles

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Monthly Billing">
    **Pricing:**
    - Pro: $19/user/month
    - Team: $39/user/month
    
    **Details:**
    - Charged on the same day each month
    - Based on your signup or upgrade date
    - Usage resets on billing date
    - User count determines total monthly charge
    - Example: Signed up Jan 15 with 10 users → billed on 15th of each month for current user count
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Annual Billing (Save 20%)">
    **Pricing:**
    - Pro: $15/user/month ($180/user/year)
    - Team: $31/user/month ($372/user/year)
    
    **Details:**
    - Charged once per year upfront
    - Save 20% compared to monthly billing
    - Billed based on current user count
    - User additions/removals prorated throughout the year
    - Example: Signed up Jan 15 with 10 users → next charge Jan 15 next year
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Per-User Pricing

Your bill is calculated based on the number of active users in your account:

**How it works:**
- Each user has their own allocation of credits and storage
- Total bill = (number of users) × (per-user rate)
- Add users anytime - charges are prorated
- Remove users anytime - credits applied at next billing

**Example (Pro Plan, Monthly):**
- 5 users × $19/user = $95/month
- Add 3 users mid-cycle → prorated charge for remaining days
- Total at next billing: 8 users × $19/user = $152/month

**Free Plan:**
- Maximum 3 users
- No per-user charges
- 500 credits shared across all users

### Prorated Charges

When you make changes mid-cycle, charges are prorated:

**How it works:**
1. Credit for unused time on old plan/user count
2. Charge for remaining time on new plan/user count
3. Net difference is charged immediately

**Example - Plan Upgrade:**
- Current: Pro plan with 5 users ($19/user = $95/month)
- Upgrade on day 15 of 30-day cycle to Team plan
- New rate: $39/user × 5 users = $195/month
- Prorated charge ≈ $50 (half the difference for remaining days)

**Example - Adding Users:**
- Current: Pro plan with 10 users ($19/user = $190/month)
- Add 5 users on day 10 of 30-day cycle
- Prorated charge for 5 users for 20 remaining days ≈ $63
- Next full billing: 15 users × $19/user = $285/month
