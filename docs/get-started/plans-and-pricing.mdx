## Understanding Your Resources

### 💳 Credits

Credits power AI operations in your workflows. Each AI request consumes credits based on the complexity and model used.

**How Credits Work:**
- Included credits refresh monthly
- Purchase additional credits anytime—they never expire and roll over to the next month
- Credits are consumed based on AI model usage and complexity
- Each plan includes discounted credit pricing for additional purchases

**Credit Pricing:**
- **Pro Plan:** $8 per 1,000 credits
- **Team Plan:** $7 per 1,000 credits (better value)
- **Enterprise:** Custom pricing and volume discounts

### 💾 Storage

The below items contribute to your account storage quota:
- Agent knowledge
- Document processing and file attachments
- System logs and monitoring data

Storage scales with your plan tier.

### 📝 Message Retention

How long your conversation history is preserved:
- **Free:** 30 days
- **Pro:** 1 year
- **Team:** Unlimited retention
- **Enterprise:** Custom retention policies

### 🔄 Concurrent Executions & Rate Limits

**Concurrent Executions:** The number of messages that can run simultaneously in your account inlcuding chat messages directly to agents, as well as automations. Higher concurrency means better responsiveness.

**Requests per Minute:** Rate limits ensure fair usage and system stability. Higher tiers provide greater throughput for production workloads and larger teams.

### 🔑 Bring Your Own Keys (Team & Enterprise)

Use your own API keys for:
- OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, and other LLM providers
- Complete cost control and transparency
- No credit consumption on LLM usage when using your own keys (credits are still consumed at 15% of the rate they would have been consumed if using included credits and also for other functions that consume credits such as web search)
- Full flexibility to choose your preferred models

### 🌍 Data Processing Regions

**Available on Enterprise plans only**

Choose where your data is processed to optimize performance and meet compliance requirements:
- Reduced latency for regional operations
- Compliance with data residency requirements (GDPR, etc.)
- Available regions: EU (UK), US, Australia (Sydney)

Enterprise customers can select their preferred data processing region during setup.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does per-user pricing work?">
    You pay based on the number of active users in your account. On the Free plan, you can have up to 3 users. On Pro and Team plans, you can add unlimited users—your bill scales with your team size.
    
    Each user gets their own allocation of credits and storage. For example, with 10 users on the Pro plan at $15/user/month, you'd pay $150/month and get 10,000 total credits (1,000 per user) plus 50GB total storage (5GB per user).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What are credits and how do they work?">
    Credits power AI operations in your workflows. Each AI request consumes credits based on the complexity and model used.
    
    - Included credits refresh monthly
    - Additional credits can be purchased at discounted rates ($8/1K for Pro, $7/1K for Team)
    - Purchased credits never expire and roll over each month
    - Use credits for any AI model supported on the platform
    - Or bring your own API keys (Team and Enterprise plans) to bypass credits entirely
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What's included in storage?">
    Storage includes everything your agents need: conversation history, workflow logs, uploaded documents, custom functions, stream/key-value/object storage, and system monitoring data. This unified storage eliminates the need for separate storage services.
    
    Storage scales per user on paid plans, so your total storage increases as your team grows.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I bring my own API keys?">
    Yes, on Team and Enterprise plans! When you use your own API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, or other providers:
    
    - You're billed directly by the provider
    - No credits are consumed from your QuivaWorks allocation
    - Complete cost transparency and control
    - Full flexibility to choose your preferred models
    
    This is perfect for organizations with existing AI provider relationships or specific model requirements.

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How does the 20% annual discount work?">
    When you commit to annual billing:
    
    - **Pro:** Pay $15/user/month (instead of $19/user/month)
    - **Team:** Pay $31/user/month (instead of $39/user/month)
    
    This is a 20% savings compared to monthly billing. You're billed annually based on your team size, and you can add/remove users throughout the year with prorated adjustments.
