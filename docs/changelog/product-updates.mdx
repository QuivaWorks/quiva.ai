## ⚡ Real-Time Chat Streaming

**See agent responses as they happen, not after they complete.**

Chat streaming is the headline feature of v1.1.0. Powered by comprehensive backend improvements, agents now stream their responses in real-time as they think and work through problems. This dramatically improves the user experience.

### What You Get
- **Instant Feedback** - Watch responses appear character-by-character as agents process information
- **Better Responsiveness** - No more waiting for long-running operations to complete
- **Improved Reliability** - Built-in message validation prevents orphaned API errors
- **Seamless Experience** - Streaming works across all chat interfaces and agent types (GraphAgent, LLM Agent, etc.)
- **Automatic Repair** - Messages are automatically validated and repaired if chat history is truncated

### How It Works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Message Validation & Repair (#683)">
    Ensures streamed messages stay synchronized even when chat history is truncated. Orphaned tool_use/tool_result pairs are automatically detected and repaired before they reach the user.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="PDF Text Extraction Improvements (#684)">
    Enhanced knowledge extraction with automatic CLI fallback when the Go library fails silently. Documents are now gracefully skipped if extraction fails, preventing cache pollution.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Optimized Message Processing">
    Reordered validation to run AFTER history truncation, catching and repairing issues before they affect users. Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Chat streaming is enabled by default and requires no configuration. Start using it immediately with any agent!
</Tip>
